The Kubernetes (K8s) architecture is designed to be highly modular and extensible.
It consists of several components that work together to manage the state of the cluster and ensure that applications are deployed and run consistently across the cluster. Here's a detailed look at the K8s architecture:

Control Plane: The control plane is the set of components that manage the overall state of the cluster. It consists of several components:
API server: This component exposes the Kubernetes API, which is used by other components to interact with the cluster.

etcd: This is a distributed key-value store that stores the configuration data for the cluster, including the state of all resources.

Scheduler: This component is responsible for scheduling pods to run on nodes in the cluster.

Controller Manager: This component manages the different controllers that are responsible for ensuring that the desired state of the cluster is maintained.


Nodes: Nodes are the worker machines that run containerized applications. Each node runs several components:
Kubelet: This is the primary agent that runs on each node and is responsible for managing the state of the node and ensuring that pods are running correctly.

Container Runtime: This is the software that runs the containers on the node, such as Docker or CRI-O.

Kube-proxy: This component is responsible for managing network traffic to and from the pods running on the node.

Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A pod is a logical host for one or more containers, and each pod runs on a single node.
Pods can share network and storage resources, making it easier to manage complex applications.

Services: Services provide a way to expose pods to the network. 
A service can load balance traffic across multiple pods and provide a stable IP address and DNS name that can be used to access the pods.

Volume: Volumes provide a way to store and share data between containers running in the same pod.
Kubernetes supports a variety of volume types, including local storage, network storage, and cloud storage.

ConfigMaps and Secrets: ConfigMaps and Secrets provide a way to store configuration data and sensitive information,
such as passwords and API keys, separately from the application code.

Overall, the K8s architecture is designed to be highly modular and flexible, allowing it to be customized to meet the needs of a wide range of use cases
