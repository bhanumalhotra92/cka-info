A Kubernetes (K8s) cluster is a set of nodes (physical or virtual machines) that run containerized applications and are managed by the Kubernetes control plane. 
The control plane is responsible for managing the state of the cluster and ensuring that the desired state of the applications is maintained.

A Kubernetes cluster typically consists of the following components:

Master node(s): This is the control plane component that manages the overall state of the cluster. 
It includes components such as the API server, etcd, and the controller manager.

Worker node(s): These are the nodes where the containerized applications are run.
Each worker node runs a Kubernetes agent called the kubelet, as well as a container runtime such as Docker or CRI-O.

Networking: A network overlay is used to enable communication between the different components of the cluster, including the pods running the containerized applications.

Add-ons: Additional components such as a container registry, a monitoring solution, and a logging solution can be added to the cluster as needed.

Kubernetes clusters can be deployed on a variety of infrastructure providers, including public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure, as well as on-premise data centers.
