Kubernetes (K8s) offers a range of features that make it a powerful tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
Here are some of the key features of Kubernetes:

Container orchestration: Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications,
making it easier to manage large numbers of containers across different environments.

Service discovery and load balancing: Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for service discovery
(Microservices service discovery is a way for applications and microservices to locate each other on a network.)
and load balancing, making it easy to distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service.

Self-healing: Kubernetes can automatically detect and replace failed containers or nodes, 
ensuring that applications remain available even in the event of failures.

Horizontal scaling: Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling of applications by adding or removing instances based on demand, 
allowing applications to automatically scale up or down as needed.

Rolling updates and rollbacks: Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks of application versions, 
allowing updates to be applied gradually to minimize disruption to users.

Resource management: Kubernetes provides tools for managing resource utilization, including CPU and memory limits,
ensuring that applications don't consume too many resources and impact other applications running on the same cluster.

Config management: Kubernetes supports declarative configuration management, 
allowing configuration changes to be applied automatically and consistently across multiple instances of an application.

Extensibility: Kubernetes is highly extensible, with a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions that allow it to integrate with other tools and services. 
This makes it easy to customize Kubernetes to meet the needs of specific use cases.
